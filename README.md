# bacmapping
This is a set of tools used in production and exploration of bacterial artificial chromosome restriction maps.

## Dataset location
This dataset is kept at gigaDB at , it can also be built locally using the scripts in installing

## Installation

We recommend creating a new enviroment

```bash
conda create -n bacmapping
conda activate bacmapping
```

This package requires:
- numpy
- pandas  1.5.2
- biopython  1.80
- matplotlib  3.6.3
- multiprocess  0.70.14

version control is probably unnecessary but included all the same

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pandas=1.5.2 biopython=1.80 multiprocess=0.70.14 matplotlib=3.6.3
```

Then clone and install this github repository on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ewinden/bacmapping/
cd bacmapping
pip install .
```
## Example
If you wish to go through the functions with an example in a jupyter notebook, look in the Examples folder for the files "bacmappingexample.ipynb" or "Ch19_bacmapping_example.ipynb". Open any this notebooks and use the bacmapping environment.


## Functions
### Main pipeline functions
- bacm.getNewClones(download = True, onlyType=True, vtype='BAC', chunk_size = 5000, email='example@website.com')
  - Download files from the FTP server
    - download is a boolean whether to download sequence files which are required, but may exist locally already
    - onlyType allows the user to only download details and sequence for one type of clone, ie BACs
    - vtype determines the type of clone
    - chunk_size determines the amount of lines to read into pandas at once, larger is faster but requires more memory
    - email should be set to the user email to allow the NIH servers to know who is accessing the database
    
- mapSequencedClones(cpustouse=1, maxcuts=50)
  - Maps all the clones which are insert sequenced
    - cpustouse determines the number of cores to use when running multiprocessing
    - maxcuts determines the maximum number of cuts with a specific enzyme before the map is truncated, to save space
    - chunk_size determines the amount of lines to read into pandas at once, larger is faster but requires more memory

- mapPlacedClones(include_libraries=True, cpustouse=1, maxcuts=50, chunk_size=500)
  - Maps all the clones which are end-sequenced and mapped to the reference genome
    - include_libraries determines whether or not to use only libraries referenced in vtype in getNewClones
    - cpustouse determines the number of cores to use when running multiprocessing
    - maxcuts determines the maximum number of cuts with a specific enzyme before the map is truncated, to save space

    - chrom is the chromosome to pull from
    - start is the location of the first base in the chromosome sequence
    - end is the location of the base after the last base in the chromosome sequence
    - inclusive determines whether BACs that overlap the start and end locations but are not wholely inside the range should be included (True means yes)

- openSeqgetCuts(row)    
  - Given a row, opens the sequence and returns all the restriction maps. This has been deprecated in the primary path, but could be useful

- narrowDownLibraries()
  - Incorporated into getNewClones, generates a file with only BAC libraries. Can be modified to include other libraries

- makeIndexFiles(loc)
  - makes index files for all BACs in a given library for easy finding
    - loc is the location of the library file used

## Use
Ensure you are on a computer/ server that can handle a large throughput and can be left for some time to download/ process everything as well as some space to save the database.
In python, the main pipeline is run as

```python
import bacmapping as bmap
from time import perf_counter

email = 'example@anexample.org' # Provide NCBI with your email when downloading sequence from them

times = []
times.append(perf_counter())
print('starting downloads')
bmap.getNewClones(download = True, onlyType=True, vtype='BAC', chunk_size = 5000, email=email)
print('This took ' + str(perf_counter()-times[-1]) + ' seconds')
times.append(perf_counter())
print('starting sequenced maps')
bmap.mapSequencedClones(cpustouse=4)
print('This took ' + str(perf_counter()-times[-1]) + ' seconds')
times.append(perf_counter())
print('starting placed maps')
bmap.mapPlacedClones(cpustouse=4,chunk_size=5000)
print('This took ' + str(perf_counter()-times[-1]) + ' seconds')

#the fundamental database has been established, the next lines describe the database

times.append(perf_counter())
print('starting stats')
bmap.countPlacedBACs()
bmap.getCoverage()
bmap.getAverageLength()
bmap.getSequencedClonesStats()
print('This took ' + str(perf_counter()-times[-1]) + ' seconds')
times.append(perf_counter())
bmap.makePairs(cpustouse=8)
print('This took ' + str(perf_counter()-times[-1]) + ' seconds')
times.append(perf_counter())
print(times)
```


Further examples on the use of Bacmapping can be found in the Jupyter notebook located in the examples folder.

## Anatomy of the database
Once the database is generated, or on the gigaDB database, restriction maps are saved first by type (insert-sequenced in sequenced or end-sequenced in placed) then library, then chromosome. Within the database are an initial set of folders and csv files, the csv files include statistics regarding the database. The details folder contains data directly downloaded from CloneDB and modified to move headers out of the files. The sequences folder contains all of the sequences included in the downloaded CloneDB files. Each chromosome csv is actually a tsv where each line is an individual BAC along with details for the BAC and then the set of cut sites for each enzyme included. Regarding cut sites, entries are either empty ([]) meaning there are no cutsites, overflow meaning the enzyme cuts more than 50 times in the BAC, or a python formatted list ([145,2352,6546]) where each cut site is included in the list.
